A versatile and flexible full stack developer, with experience working across a wide range of technologies and projects in a pragmatic and collaborative environment as part of a small team. Able to work with stakeholders to specify and build products which meet the businessâ€™s requirements. Committed to supporting colleagues and driving team performance, and keen to build effective relationships by leading and inspiring. Possessing great prioritisation, analytical, multitasking and decision making skills.

I enjoy working on products end-to-end, and finding sensible solutions to interesting problems.
