I'm David Miles, and I've been writing software for over 20 years using a wide variety of tools and technologies. Recently, I've been focusing on full stack development using .NET, but in the past I've worked on desktop software using .NET Forms and WPF, mobile apps for Android and iOS, educational courseware, and even embedded development for ARM and PIC microcontrollers.

In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with photography, playing and dabbling at making video games, and working on a projects like [these](/projects).

I enjoy working on products end-to-end, and finding sensible solutions to interesting problems.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities, and you can find my CV [here]($link.asset('CV.pdf')).
